### My name is Ivan. I recently graduated from the Lambda School Data Science program. I've highlighted some of the projects I've worked on.

### I'm currently looking for work! Feel free to visit my website at <!--TODO-->

### I'm interested in open source projects and making the world better through the lens of Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and someday AI.

### I have a public Roam where I mostly review books with my thoughts and summarizations.
