### My name is Ivan. I recently graduated from the Lambda School Data Science program.

### I'm currently looking for work! Feel free to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-s-santos/) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Algorant) <br><br>

### I am interested in:
* ### Open source projects,
* ### Making the world better through the lens of Machine Learning,
* ### The intersection between Data Analysis and Dataviz.

### I have a public Roam where I mostly review books with my thoughts.



### I've highlighted some of the tools I use projects I've worked on and am proud of below:
